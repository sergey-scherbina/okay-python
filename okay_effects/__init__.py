"""okay-python: algebraic effects for Python, typed, on generators.

A handler makes a capability and hands it to its body; the body performs
operations through it with ``yield from cap.perform(op)``, typed by what the
operation answers. A program is a generator: performing suspends it, the
handler that owns the capability answers, the program resumes. A handler
answers only ITS capability's operations — by identity, not by type — so two
instances of one effect coexist; an operation of another passes outward. A
capability used after its handler returned is refused by name.

The design of okay (Scala 3) and okay-go, in Python.
